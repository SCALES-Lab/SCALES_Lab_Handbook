Welcome to the SCALES Lab!

## Study of Cognition and Learning in Educational Systems

The SCALES Lab investigates how educational outcomes emerge from the complex interplay of cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental forces. We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.

Our research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.

## Who We Are

SCALES is a collaborative research space for graduate students, faculty, and partners who are curious, rigorous, and ready to rethink how we study education. We welcome scholars from diverse disciplines — especially those who care about educational equity, systems-level change, and developing stronger methods for understanding how learning happens.

## What We Do
•	Build ecological models of learning and achievement  
•	Use AI and simulation to test educational theories  
•	Develop new tools for causal inference and data integration  
•	Mentor students in cutting-edge methods and policy-relevant research  
•	Collaborate across institutions, disciplines, and communities
