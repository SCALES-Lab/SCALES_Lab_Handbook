    "text": "Study of Cognition and Learning in Educational Systems\nThe SCALES Lab investigates how educational outcomes emerge from the complex interplay of cognitive, social, institutional, and environmental forces. We approach education not as a collection of isolated interventions or outcomes, but as a dynamic system shaped by feedback loops, structural conditions, and resource distribution.\nOur research focuses on understanding these systems through rigorous, theory-driven modeling — integrating insights from cognitive science, ecology, data science, and education policy. Rather than centering normative agendas, we aim to develop tools and evidence that clarify how learning environments function and how access to educational resources can be broadened across diverse contexts.",
